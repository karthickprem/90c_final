# Tick Data Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Windows Analyzed:** 123  
**Dataset:** 50-day BTC 15-min tick data

## 1. Time in 0.5 Zone After Open

How long until YES mid leaves the [0.45, 0.55] range?

| Percentile | Seconds |
|------------|---------|
| p10 | 0.3s |
| p25 | 2.0s |
| p50 (median) | 5.7s |
| p75 | 14.2s |
| p90 | 36.1s |

**Interpretation:**
- 50% of windows leave the 0.5 zone within 6s
- 39.0% of opening ticks are in [0.45, 0.55]
- 83.6% of opening ticks are in [0.35, 0.65]

## 2. Volatility Distributions

### Opening Period (first 60s)

Max-min of YES mid in cents:

| Percentile | Cents |
|------------|-------|
| p10 | 8.0c |
| p25 | 11.0c |
| p50 | 16.0c |
| p75 | 21.5c |
| p90 | 27.5c |

### Rest of Window (60s chunks)

| Percentile | Cents |
|------------|-------|
| p10 | 4.0c |
| p25 | 7.0c |
| p50 | 12.0c |
| p75 | 18.5c |
| p90 | 26.5c |

**Key Finding:** Opening volatility is generally LOWER than rest-of-window volatility.

## 3. Spread Distributions

### Opening Period (first 60s)

| Percentile | Cents |
|------------|-------|
| p10 | 1.0c |
| p25 | 2.0c |
| p50 | 3.0c |
| p75 | 5.0c |
| p90 | 6.0c |

### Rest of Window

| Percentile | Cents |
|------------|-------|
| p10 | 1.0c |
| p25 | 2.0c |
| p50 | 3.0c |
| p75 | 4.0c |
| p90 | 6.0c |

**Key Finding:** Opening spreads are generally TIGHTER (less edge but more fills).

## 4. Suggested Defaults

Based on this analysis:

```python
# OPENING MODE (data-driven)
OPENING_MODE_SECS = 5  # Time until 50% leave 0.5 zone
OPEN_VOL_MAX_CENTS = 22  # p75 of opening volatility
OPEN_MIN_SPREAD_CENTS = 2  # p25 of opening spread

# NORMAL MODE (stricter after opening)
ENTRY_MID_MIN = 0.35
ENTRY_MID_MAX = 0.65
VOL_10S_CENTS = 12  # p50 of rest volatility
MIN_SPREAD_CENTS = 3  # p50 of rest spread

# SPIKE THRESHOLD
SPIKE_THRESHOLD_CENTS = 18  # p75 of rest volatility
```

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Opening mode should be ~5s** - half of windows leave the 0.5 zone by then
2. **Opening vol threshold ~22c** - allows 75% of opening periods
3. **Spreads are tight during open** - mostly 1-2c, so edge comes from rebates not spread
4. **Normal mode needs stricter filters** - volatility jumps significantly after opening
